Biometric Attendance System
This Biometric Attendance System is a time and attendance tracking system designed to help staff or teachers organize courses, manage students, and track attendance using the most unique physical identifierâ€”fingerprints. It leverages computer vision (Python OpenCV), Flask, and the MERN stack to ensure accurate, efficient, and secure attendance management.

Note: The system has been developed and tested specifically with the DigitalPersona U.are.U 4500 fingerprint scanner and is currently supported on Windows OS only.

Hardware Supported

Project Structure
The project is structured into three core sections for smooth functionality:

Frontend (React): Handles the user interface and client-side logic.
Backend (Flask): Manages business logic, API requests, and database communication.
Biometric Integration (Python OpenCV): Incorporates the biometric hardware for fingerprint scanning and verification.

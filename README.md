Biometric Attendance System
This biometric attendance system is a time and attendance tracking system that allows staff or teachers to organize courses, manage students, and mark students' attendance using their unique physical characteristicsâ€”their fingerprints. It's built using computer vision (Python OpenCV), Flask, and the MERN stack.

NB: This system has been built and tested with The DigitalPersona U.are.U 4500 scanner only. It currently supports Windows OS.

Project Structure
The project is divided into three sections:

Frontend (React): User interface and client-side logic.
Backend (Flask): Manages the API, database communication, and business logic.
Biometric Integration (Python OpenCV): Handles fingerprint scanning and verification using the biometric hardware.

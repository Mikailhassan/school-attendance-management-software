# Biometric Attendance System

This biometric attendance system is a time and attendance tracking system that allows staff or teachers to organize courses, manage students, and mark students' attendance using their unique physical characteristicsâ€”their fingerprints. It's built using computer vision (Python OpenCV), Flask, and the MERN stack.

NB: This system has been built and tested with The DigitalPersona U.are.U 4500 scanner only. It currently supports Windows OS.

Below is an image of the DigitalPersona U.are.U 4500 scanner:

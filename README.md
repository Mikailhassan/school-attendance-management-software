# Biometric Attendance System

This biometric attendance system is a time and attendance tracking system that allows staff or teachers to organize courses, manage students and mark students' attendance using their most unique physical characteristicsâ€”their fingerprints. It's built with computer vision (Python OpenCV), Flask and the MERN stack.

**NB**: This system has been built and tested with The DigitalPersona U.are.U 4500 scanner only. It only supports Windows OS for now.
